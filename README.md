# om_skeleton
This is a public, reusable skeleton for building multi-page, multi-user web sites based on R and Shiny, including user authentication (logging in and logging out).

Open the app folder above and you can look at the individual files, which are extensively commented. 

There's also a post on the Open-Meta.org blog at: http://www.open-meta.org/technology/multi-page-url-based-shiny-web-site-skeleton-with-authentication/

You can see what the skeleton looks like when it's running here: http://dev.open-meta.org/site/om_skeleton/
